# Mandelbrot set in WebAssembly

An attempt to generate one of the most famous fractals with C code compiled to WebAssembly
and show it graphically on a movable and zoomable HTML5 canvas.
Currently, for some reason the performance is much better on Firefox.

The code was compiled using [WasmFiddle](https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/).
